# LangGraph 1.0 Released: No Breaking Changes, All the Hard-Won Lessons

The internet is full of agent demos that work great in Jupyter notebooks and fall apart the moment you try to scale them. Your agent stops mid-execution when the server restarts. You can't inspect what it's doing without adding print statements everywhere. Human oversight means blocking your terminal with an `input()` prompt. That's not productionâ€”that's a science fair project.

[LangGraph 1.0](https://blog.langchain.com/langchain-langchain-1-0-alpha-releases/) just shipped, and it's the stabilization of the runtime that companies like Uber, LinkedIn, and Klarna already depend on in production. Zero breaking changes. All the hard-won lessons from running agents at scale, now baked into a stable API.
